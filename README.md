### Notes

-   If Android produces a build error (something about plugins), delete the MainActivity.kt file and try again. This bug appeared in flutter beta. I couldn't reproduce it on flutter stable, but who knows what happens.
-   The web version has issues:
    -   shadow bug on hud
    -   performance issue
    -   WAY too strong glow on moon
    -   thunderstorm freezes the page
    -   svg icon doesn't render
